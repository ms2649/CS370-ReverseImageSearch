* The problem we will be investigating is **Reverse Visual Search**. It is interesting because it is a very common and useful application of machine learning modeling, used for instance to discover matching items in a catalog of products for ecommerce website, finding the same person throughout your pictures on your phone, finding the source of a cat meme you found on the internet. 
* The reading that we wil examine to provide background and context are the course textoks:  *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*, *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* and relevant scholarly sources and online articles as well as any other source from which we can dervive greater understanding of project for.
* The data we will use is providing from Stanford via the LFW dataset.
* At present we believe the best approach for this project would be to implement deep learning via a CNN as it is a very popular way of classification of similarity within visual mediums.
* We plan to evaluate our results by setting aside a small percentage of the LFW dataset to do our validation on and checking the results manually. The expected results of the model is similiar images to the original input images.
